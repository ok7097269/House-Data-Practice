Getting hard core","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It's time to go deep and understand how 'SalePrice' complies with the statical assumptions that enables us to appy multivariate techniques.\n\nccording to [Hair et al. (2013)](https://amzn.to/2uC3j9p), four assumptions should be tested:\n\n* <b>Normality</b> - When we talk about normality what we mean is that the data should look like a normal distribution. This is important because several statistic tests rely  on this (e.g. t-statistics). In this exercise we'll just check univariate normality for 'SalePrice' (which is a limited approach). Remember that univariate normality doesn't ensure multivariate normality (which is what we would like to have), but it helps. Another detail to take into account is that in big samples (>200 observations) normality is not such an issue. However, if we solve normality, we avoid a lot of other problems (e.g. heteroscedacity) so that's the main reason why we are doing this analysis.\n\n* <b>Homoscedasticity</b> - I just hope I wrote it right. Homoscedasticity refers to the 'assumption that dependent variable(s) exhibit equal levels of variance across the range of predictor variable(s)' [(Hair et al., 2013)](https://amzn.to/2uC3j9p). Homoscedasticity is desirable because we want the error term to be the same across all values of the independent variables.\n\n* <b>Linearity</b>- The most common way to assess linearity is to examine scatter plots and search for linear patterns. If patterns are not linear, it would be worthwhile to explore data transformations. However, we'll not get into this because most of the scatter plots we've seen appear to have linear relationships.\n\n* <b>Absence of correlated errors</b> - Correlated errors, like the definition suggests, happen when one error is correlated to another. For instance, if one positive error makes a negative error systematically, it means that there's a relationship between these variables. This occurs often in time series, where some patterns are time related. We'll also not get into this. However, if you detect something, try to add a variable that can explain the effect you're getting. That's the most common solution for correlated errors.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### In the search for normality","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Test 'SalePrice' in a very lean way.\n\n* Histogram - kurtosis and skewness.\n* Normal probability plot = Data distribution should closely follow the diagonal that represents the normal distribution.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#histogram and normal probability plot\nsns.distplot(df_train['SalePrice'], fit=norm)\nfig = plt.figure()\nres = stats.probplot(df_train['SalePrice'], plot=plt)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T15:38:31.590142Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T15:38:31.590409Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T15:38:32.211466Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T15:38:31.590370Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T15:38:32.210835Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"'SalePrice' is not normal.
